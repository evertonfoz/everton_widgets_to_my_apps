# everton_widgets_to_my_apps

During my process of studying and investigating Flutter, I did several tests, creating various widgets. Recently, in two projects, which share the same visual identity, referring to widgets, I saw the need to have these widgets in a package, because when updates, corrective or evolutionary could occur, they would be in a single place. This is the reason for creating this component, which I hope will be useful to you.

## Widgets presentes no pacote

1. **AppBarECA**

   É um StatelessWidget, que recebe, em seu construtor, três argumentos:

   - List<Widget> actions;
   - double elevation;
   - Widget? leading;

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
